During this lab we will use **Weka Experimenter.**

The Weka Experimenter allows you to design your own experiments of running algorithms on datasets, run the experiments and analyze the results. It's a powerful tool.


You can follow the lab guide to familiarize with the experimenter.


Now we will launch an experience on 3 datasets: Iris , Weather and Glass. We will use the algorithms of: J48, NaiveBayes, RandomForest.

The outcome of the experimenter is in the result.csv file.
