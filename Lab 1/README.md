 During this lab we will use **weka** software (Waikato environment for knowledge analysis)

Weka is a collection of **machine learning** algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data **pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.**


Weka is free to use : https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/


During this lab we will use the user interface of weka

Make sure to copy the content of (C:\Program Files\Weka-3-8\data) in your working directory: we will need it in this lab

Choose the explorer: 6 options are available:

Data format is ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format)

click open file in Preprocess and choose any dataset from the data files. We chose weather.nominal.arff

Weka helps in the visualization of the data and the different outcomes of mixing attributes.

You can try selecting different attributes and using the ALL,NONE,INVERT options..


 **iris.arff** is the most used dataset for data mining researchs.

 The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

Go to the visualize window, you can see 25 graphics combinig each 2 attributes with the classes colored.

The lab suggests that we choose petal width as X and sepal length as Y:
