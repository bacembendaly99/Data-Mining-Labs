 During this lab we will use **weka** software (Waikato environment for knowledge analysis)

Weka is a collection of **machine learning** algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data **pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.**


Weka is free to use : https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/


During this lab we will use the user interface of weka
<br><br>

<br>
Make sure to copy the content of (C:\Program Files\Weka-3-8\data) in your working directory: we will need it in this lab

Choose the explorer: 6 options are available:
<br><br>

Data format is ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format)

click open file in Preprocess and choose any dataset from the data files. We chose weather.nominal.arff
<br><br>

Weka helps in the visualization of the data and the different outcomes of mixing attributes.

You can try selecting different attributes and using the ALL,NONE,INVERT options..


 **iris.arff** is the most used dataset for data mining researchs.

 The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

Go to the visualize window, you can see 25 graphics combinig each 2 attributes with the classes colored.

The lab suggests that we choose petal width as X and sepal length as Y:
<br>

if we choose class(nom) as an axe, we can conclude some association laws:
in this example iris-setosa is linked with low petal length values:

The jitter option can get another distribution of points if they are not clear.

# **Decision Trees**

We will reopen weather.nominal.arff and use J48 algorithm

Classify >> Trees >> J48 >> Start

J48 Classifier is an algorithm to generate a decision tree that is generated by C4. 5 (an extension of ID3). It is also known as a statistical classifier.

We can visualize the decision tree (right click on model name)

# Preprocessing Data

open bank-data.arff


<br>
Weka include many filters that can be used before invoking a classifier to clean up the dataset, or alter it in some way. Filters help with data preparation.

<br>

Attribute selection is a supervised attribute filter that can be used to select attributes. It is very flexible and allows various search and evaluation methods to be combined.

<br>
Discretize filter is an instance filter that discretizes a range of numeric attributes in the dataset into nominal attributes. Discretization is by simple binning.
