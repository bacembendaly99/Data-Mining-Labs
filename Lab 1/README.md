 During this lab we will use **weka** software (Waikato environment for knowledge analysis)

Weka is a collection of **machine learning** algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data **pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.**


Weka is free to use : https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/


During this lab we will use the user interface of weka
